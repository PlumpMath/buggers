;; Changes
;; =======
;; Changes take a gameworld and parameters and return a new gameworld.
;; They are all pure functions.
;; They also must be called from within the main render loop. Systems
;; are fair game but if you want to call them from a background job
;; precompute all you need and send the actual updating function
;; (which includes these function calls) in the send execute thing
;; libgdx has built in. TODO: Wrap that functionality in clojure.
